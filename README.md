[The Future of Software Engineering - GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/the-future-of-software-engineering/)

## Reflection
What's interesting about the article is that it doesn't just talk about "coding getting better", but frames software engineering as something that's actively shifting shape. It highlights how AI tools, low code platforms, and automation aren't replacing developers so much as changing what developers spend their time on. Instead of grinding out boilerplate, engineers are moving more toward system design, problem framing, and integrating smart tools into their work flow. It's less about typing things and more about orchestrating.

It's also cool because it shows how broad software dev has become. The article connects trends like DevOps, Cloud infrastructure, and security into one big picture, which makes it clear that modern devs are kind of hybrid builders now.

### Comment from Aayan Mathur

What stands out to me about this article is how it emphasizes adaptability as the core skill for future developers. The tech landscape is evolving so rapidly that being able to learn and pivot quickly matters more than mastering any single technology.

I also appreciate how the article acknowledges that while automation and AI are powerful, the human elements remain irreplaceable.
