# Reflection
What's interesting about the article is that it doesn't just talk about "coding getting better", but frames software engineering as something that's actively shifting shape. It highlights how AI tools, low code platforms, and automation aren't replacing developers so much as changing what developers spend their time on. Instead of grinding out boilerplate, engineers are moving more toward system design, problem framing, and integrating smart tools into their work flow. It's less about typing things and more about orchestrating.

It's also cool because it shows how broad software dev has become. The article connects trends like DevOps, Cloud infrastructure, and security into one big picture, which makes it clear that modern devs are kind of hybrid builders now.
